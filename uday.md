Hi Uday,

I've added a folder in tests called Uday which shows how you'd implement a locator approach as you talked about.

In terms of the multiple environments, [this project](https://github.com/Thara90/Playwright_POM) seems like a great example which might be helpful. There's a [blogpost here](https://medium.com/ascentic-technology/test-multiple-environments-locally-in-playwright-with-env-file-1c41b792822) that explores it.

Hope that helps!

Kevin.
